## FittFamm Challenge Project
#### Due Week of May 15th

### Overview
> FittFamm is a social network based around fitness. So for this challenge project you are once again going to be using Twitter, and HealthKit.

### Challenge
> This challenge will be straight forward. Using the Twitter App SDK, build an iOS (iPhone only) application in your choice of Swift or Objective-C that allows a user to enter their heart rate in the correct metric to HealthKit and simultaneously post that as as a formatted message to a Twitter account. You can decide whether you login in with the app or hard code your account.

### Directions
> Build your application in Xcode, then pull this repo and add it to the Submissions folder in this directory in a folder named "First Name"-"Last Name".
