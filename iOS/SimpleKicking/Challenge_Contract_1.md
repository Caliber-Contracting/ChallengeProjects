## SimpleKicking Challenge Project
#### Due Week of May 15th

### OverView
> SimpleKicking is a sports analytics company out of Dallas, TX. For this challenge project, you are to build an application that allows a user to take a video and keep it persisted in a tableView inside the application. Then build a custom player that has a textfield below it saying "Where information should go.".

### Challenge
