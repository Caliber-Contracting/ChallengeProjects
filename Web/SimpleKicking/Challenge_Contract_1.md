## SimpleKicking Challenge Project
#### Due Week of May 15th
#### Rails is recommended, but you may use any web app framework such as Angular, etc.

### Overview
> SimpleKicking is a sports analytics company out of Dallas, TX. For this challenge project, you are building a small rails web-app.

### Challenge
> This challenge will be straight forward. Build a rails site that allows a user to input a numerical value and the current date and time. Then have another page that allows the user to see a graph of all these values. There does not need to be separate user accounts, just two pages one for entering data, another for viewing it as a chart.

### Directions
> Build your application with Rails, then pull this repo and add it to the Submissions folder in this directory in a folder named "First Name"-"Last Name".
